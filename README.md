## Bioinformatics :dna:
# All sorts of small helpful Python algorithms and functions for Bioinformatics.

A collection of multiple Jupyter Notebooks, containing functions for use in the field of bioinformatics. Mostly they are derivatives of BioPython library, but some might find some of these functions quite useful.

Most of them will demand you to use the FASTA file format, which is a standard in Genomics. You can read more about FASTA file format [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format). 
For parsing multiple sequences in FASTA format, you can refer to the readFastaQ function [here](https://github.com/msx-dev/Bioinformatics/blob/main/BioFunctions/readFastaQ.ipynb) in this repository. 
For parsing a single genome, you can refer to the getGenome function [here](https://github.com/msx-dev/Bioinformatics/blob/main/BioFunctions/getGenome.ipynb).
